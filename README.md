## 🖥️ Usage

> ⚠️ **Run as Administrator**  
> ShrineTool performs system-level rituals that require elevated permissions.

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (MSVC recommended).
2. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./ShrineTool.exe


   🛡️ Is ShrineTool Safe?
Yes. ShrineTool is open-source, transparent, and built with care. Every tweak is visible in the source — no obfuscation, no hidden binaries.

⚠️ Why SmartScreen or Defender Might Warn You
Windows flags unsigned tools by default, especially those that:

Modify system settings (telemetry, Bing, GPS)

Use KMS activation logic

Are new and haven’t built reputation yet

These are heuristic triggers, not actual threats.

✅ How to Verify ShrineTool
🔍 Inspect the source: GitHub Repository

🧪 Scan the compiled .exe with VirusTotal

🧵 Compile it yourself using Visual Studio or g++

“If you doubt the ritual, read the scrolls. If you trust the shrine, run the ceremony.”
